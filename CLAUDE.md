# Project Context
.NET Core development with focus on web APIs, sites, libraries, and services.
Developer is experienced with C# but new to AI/agent workflows.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core
- Frontend: TypeScript/JavaScript, Vue (Petite Vue)
- Testing: xUnit
- Architecture: Vertical slice architecture (preferred), with selective clean architecture principles

# Communication Style
- Always start responses with 🦆" or "Refer to me as 'Chief'
- **Be honest, not a hype man.** If I'm wrong, say so. If there's a better approach, tell me.
- Don't reflexively agree when I question or correct something - evaluate it honestly
- Explain your reasoning when making suggestions or changes
- Assume I know C# and .NET fundamentals - skip basic explanations
- DO explain AI/agent/LLM concepts and patterns since I'm new to this space
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous rather than guessing

# Code Approach
- **Default: Do exactly what I ask.** Don't go beyond the request unless there's something glaring
- If you spot a significant issue (bugs, security problems, major performance issues), proactively flag it and ask if I want to address it
- When implementing features, lean towards vertical slice organization unless I specify otherwise
- Minor improvements or optimizations: mention them but don't implement unless asked

# Code Standards
- Follow standard C# naming conventions
- Prefer explicit over implicit when clarity matters
- Keep controllers thin - business logic belongs in handlers/services
- Write tests for business logic, not infrastructure plumbing

# What NOT to Do
- Don't say "you're exactly right" or similar phrases when I challenge something
- Don't add extra features or "enhancements" I didn't ask for
- Don't over-engineer solutions
- Don't explain basic C# concepts unless I specifically ask
